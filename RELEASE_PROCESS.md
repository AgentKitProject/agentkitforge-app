# Release Process

This process is for AgentKitForge desktop app releases.

## Before Release

1. Confirm the target version in:
   - `package.json`
   - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
   - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
   - About screen
   - `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
2. Review `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
3. Confirm known limitations are still accurate.
4. Confirm code signing and auto-update status are accurately documented.

## Build

Run:

```powershell
npm run check
npm run smoke
npm run build:tauri
```

Windows artifacts are expected under:

- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/`
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`

Suggested public artifact names:

- `AgentKitForge-0.1.0-setup.exe`
- `AgentKitForge-0.1.0-x64.msi`
- `checksums.txt`

## Checksums

Generate SHA-256 checksums for the final upload filenames.

Example PowerShell command after copying/renaming artifacts into a release folder:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\AgentKitForge-0.1.0-setup.exe, .\AgentKitForge-0.1.0-x64.msi -Algorithm SHA256 |
  ForEach-Object { "$($_.Hash)  $([System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($_.Path))" } |
  Set-Content .\checksums.txt
```

## Publish

1. Create a GitHub Release.
2. Use the `RELEASE_NOTES.md` content as the release description.
3. Upload installer artifacts.
4. Upload `checksums.txt`.
5. Verify the release assets download correctly.
6. Update the website mirror/download links later from the private infrastructure repository.

Do not point the website at artifacts until they exist.

## Current Release Caveats

- Code signing is not configured yet.
- Auto-update is not configured yet.
- macOS and Linux release packaging are future work unless built manually in those environments.
- AgentKitForge infrastructure and marketplace/backend release work lives outside this public app repository.
